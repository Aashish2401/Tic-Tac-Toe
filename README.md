# Tic-Tac-Toe
A CLI Tic Tac Toe game with computer opponent option.
The python game uses a MIN-MAX algorithm to find the best next move for the computer opponent.
The C++ implementation uses a different approach where it has 2 options, a 2 player option, or a single player option in which the computer player is manually coded to check if it has a chance to win or to defend if the opponent may win.
